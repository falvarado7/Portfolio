  <h1>Hi! I'm Francisco Alvarado</h1>
  <p>I am a Software Developer student at Thinkful living in Houston, Texas</p>

    <ul class="list">

  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <div class="aboutMe">
    <p>I've always had a passion for computers, they've always come natural to me. While welding is pretty easy for
    me I knew that I didn't want to weld for the rest of my life so I enrolled into Thinkful, and this has been the
    best decison of my life.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I recently had a baby and shes given me a drive like no other. I taught myself how to weld pipe and was teaching
      myself how to code a little. I enrolled in Thinkful and have set my mind to complete it and pursue the career 
      I've always wanted for my baby.
